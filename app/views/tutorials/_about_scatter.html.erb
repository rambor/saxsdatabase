<p class="about">
Sc&#8491;tter is a JAVA-based application for basic analysis of SAXS datasets. Sc&#8491;tter is developed by Robert Rambo at the Diamond Light Source (Didcot, UK). The program was previously developed at the SIBYLS beamline (12.3.1) of the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, CA.</p>

<ul id="Requirement">
<li><span>JAVA requirement:</span><p class="about"> JAVA 8 (platform 1.8) or greater for Windows, Mac OS X or LINUX</p>
<li><span>Starting Sc&#8491;tter:</span>
<p class="about"> Sc&#8491;tter comes as a compressed zip file. Unzip the file into a directory, typically accomplished by double clicking the downloaded file. If the file was unzipped in a "Downloads" directory, simply drag the entire unzipped directory to a more permanent location.</p>
<%= image_tag('scatter_directory.png', :width=>'250') %>
<p class="about">Open the directory and double-click "scatter.jar". The *.jar file can be moved to any suitable directory, just be sure to have the directory available to the system by setting appropriate path statements.</p>
	
<p class="about"><span class="blue_text">Windows</span> and <span class="darkred_text">LINUX</span> users! Depending on security settings, Sc&#8491;tter may be started from command line using "java -jar scatter.jar" </p>	

<p class="about"><span class="red_text">Apple OSX</span> users: Scatter can be added to the dock. Just drag the jar file to the area next to the trash can.  See <%= link_to "link", "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8916269/launching-a-jar-file-as-an-app-on-mac-from-the-dock", :class=> "no_decor_link" %>.</p>
<li><span>Intensity file:</span><p class="about"> Sc&#8491;tter can read any 3 column text file (column 1: q, column 2: Intensity, column 3: error ) delimited by space or tabs.  Header or footer information starting with # will be ignored.  In addition, Sc&#8491;tter can read Bruker *.brml SAXS file formats. If you are experiencing problems, please contact Robert Rambo.</p>

<h1 class="welcometitle">Future Updates</h1>
<p class="about">
	<ul>
	<li>Independent component analysis for resolving individual scattering curves of components in a mixture.</li>
	<li>Direct fitting of PDB models to scattering profiles.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h1 class="welcometitle">Disclaimer</h1>
<p class="about">JAVA is a platform independent language that is entirely objected oriented. We tried to optimize the analysis around the object oriented platform. Sc&#8491;tter is currently not released as an open source package but we are willing to share source code with collaborators.</p>

<h5>Release 2.1 c - June 30, 2014</h5>
<p class="about">Version 2.1c fixes a few bugs and has some added features by request:</p>
<ul>	
<li>Data is exported on Results tab</li>
<li>Filenames are no longer auto-generated (2FILE P(r) tab)</li>
<li>The previous specified working directory will be set on start-up</li>
<li>Limited access to ATSAS (DATGNOM AND DAMMIN/F) from Sc&#8491;tter GUI</li>
<li>User must specify directory of the ATSAS binaries in Settings tab</li>
<li>2File (on P(r) tab) automatically calls DATGNOM on the data visible in plot</li>
<li>Output from DATGNOM is auto-loaded into DAMMIN/F tab for modeling.</li>
<li>Truncation of data in manual Guinier analysis carries over to the working dataset in Analysis tab</li>
<li>Crosshairs can be toggled off by right-click on graph (popup menu)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Release 2.0 beta - January 3, 2014</h5>
<p class="about">Version 2.0 is a major re-write of the entire program. Due to several bugs and user feedback, Scatter was refactored and improved with the following additional features:</p>
<ul>	
<li>Unlimited data files per collection</li>
<li>Output SVG and PDF formats</li>
<li>Colors and point size editor for individual datasets</li>
<li>Buffer subtraction </li>
<li>Multi-file chi<sub>free</sub> calculations</li>
<li>Regularized inverse transform using L1-norm</li>
<li>Complex formation detection algorithm</li>
<li>I(0)/Rg plots over all visible datasets</li>
</ul>
<p class="about">
This is a beta release and we appreciate bug reporting from our users.

<h5>Release 1.7i - July 31, 2013</h5>
<p class="about">Fixed bug in windows 7, 8 and LINUX, program would not start due to error in determining home directory.</p>

<h5>Release 1.7f - July 20, 2013</h5>
<p class="about">Fixed Windows 8 bug (directory determination would halt start of program).</p>
<p class="about">Corrected scaling of mass when scale factor is not 1.0 when using Vc button.</p>

<h5>Release 1.7e - July 19, 2013</h5>
<p class="about">Fixed repopulating of Results tab.</p>

<h5>Release 1.7d - July 18, 2013</h5>
<p class="about">Fixed auto-zoom that was only affecting data with the max I(q) <  1.</p>

<p class="about">Fixed bug in Guinier fitting. For datasets with I(q) < 1 in Guinier region, auto_Rg and manual Guinier would initially report -1 and 0 for I(0) and Rg until data was adjusted manually.  Now, Scatter reports the proper parameters.</p>
<br>
<h5>Release 1.7c - July 16, 2013</h5>
<p class="about">Fixed Chi_free calculation. FOXS rounds the q-value to one less significant figure. Scatter now actively rounds the number to find corresponding number in FOXS fit file. Rounded numbers are printed to console.</p>
