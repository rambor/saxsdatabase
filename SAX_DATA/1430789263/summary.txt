#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	HU aa DNA
BIOISIS_ID	

EXP_DESCRIPTION	Here we determined crystal structures of these chromosome-associated proteins in complex with native duplex DNA. Distinct DNA-binding modes of HUαα- and HUαβ elucidate fundamental features of bacterial chromosome packing regulating gene transcription. By combining crystal structures with solution X-ray scattering results, we determined architectures of HU’s-DNA nucleoproteins in near physiological conditions

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	SAXS data were collected at the ALS beamline 12.3.1 (SIBYLS) LBNL Berkeley, California (11) for HU concentrations of 17 to 200 μM spanning the measured intracellular HU concentrations of 25-100 μM (12). The wavelength λ=1.0 Å and sample-to-detector distances were set to 1.5m, resulting in scattering vectors, q, ranging from 0.01 Å-1 to 0.32 Å-1. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle
