#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	SAXS analysis of human interleukin-11
BIOISIS_ID	hil11P
EXP_DESCRIPTION	Interleukin (IL)-11 is a multifunctional member of the IL-6 family of cytokines. Scattering data were collected from a 1.5 mm glass capillary at 10Â°C under continuous flow (0.2 ml/min) with 2 second frames. hIL-11 (10 mg/ml) was eluted directly into the capillary from an in-line Superdex 200 5/150 size-exclusion column.
SOURCE_LOCATION	Australian Synchrotron SAXS/WAXS

#REMARK NO MODEL
DESCRIPTION	SAXS data were acquired to complement the crystal structure and analytical ultracentrifuge analysis of hIL-11. Solution studies closely match our crystallographic model and suggest a stable monomeric structure for hIL-11.
