#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Structure of the VS ribozyme

BIOISIS_ID	

EXP_DESCRIPTION	VS ribozyme SAXS data. A dimer of the ribozyme fits the data significantly better than a monomer (χ / χfree  = 26.1 / 26.3 for the dimer, in comparison to 59.0 / 59.1 for the monomer), particularly at low q. We suspect that differences at higher q are largely due to movement helix 7, which makes relatively few interactions with the rest of the structure, and is thus likely to be flexible in solution. Pair-distance distribution curves calculated from experimental versus model-derived scattering also better support a dimer model. Finally, ab initio bead models calculated from the experimental data are visually consistent with the dimer model.

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	SAXS data with a q range from 0.012467 Å-1 to 0.324398 Å-1 were collected from eight concentrations ranging from 1.5 mg/mL to 4.5 mg/mL, each with exposures of 0.5, 1 and 6 seconds. Buffer blanks were performed both before and after each sample exposure and subtracted from the sample signal. Within each concentration, each buffer-subtracted exposure was checked for radiation damage and any oversaturated points were removed before being averaged together. The final experimental scattering curve was calculated by scaling the averaged datasets for each concentration to the highest concentration (4.5 mg/mL) dataset and merging with extrapolation to infinite dilution.
