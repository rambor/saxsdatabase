#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	PF1733  - Aggregated
DESCRIPTION	PF1733 is currently listed as a conserved hypothetical. This was one of the few truly un-analyzable data sets from a set of 16 produced by Mike Adams in the first MAGGIE set. The protein needs an entirely new look from the beginning.

#REMARK NO MODEL
DESCRIPTION	The scattering profile has no features. The Dmax is challenging to define. The Kratky plot is hopeful but this is most likely a mixture with some species of large size.
