#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	PF1733  - Aggregated
BIOISIS_ID	6HYPHP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	The scattering profile has no features. The Dmax is challenging to define. The Kratky plot is hopeful but this is most likely a mixture with some species of large size.
SOURCE_LOCATION	ALS BL 12.3.1 SIBYLS
PUBLICATION	Robust, high-throughput solution structural analyses by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Nat Methods. 2009 Aug;6(8):606-12.
