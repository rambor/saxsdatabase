#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Modeling of SAM-1 Riboswitch (apo state)
BIOISIS_ID	1SAMRR
EXP_DESCRIPTION	SAM-1 riboswitch binds a small metabolite (SAM). Crystal structures of bound and unbound states demonstrate nearly identical structures unlike the solution state where SAXS data showed two different states of the riboswitch. The riboswitch appears to occupy a single bound state in the presence of SAM identical to the crystal structure whereas in the absence of SAM, the riboswitch appears to occupy many conformational states. Based on the X-ray crystal structure, SAXS data in the absence of SAM-1 was used as a modeling constraint in torsion angle molecular dynamic simulations.  Results demonstrate a scissoring of the riboswitch for opening the metabolite binding site.
