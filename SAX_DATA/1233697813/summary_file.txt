#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Solution Structure of the Unbound Lysine Riboswitch from T. maritima
DESCRIPTION	This experiment is part of a larger study examining the various conformational states of the lysine riboswitch.  Through SAXS, We have found that the bound and unbound forms of the lysine riboswitch adopt a nearly identical structure in solution.  Ligand binding does not appear to alter the conformational state of the molecule but rather alters a competing secondary structure during transcription of the endogenous gene.  The SAXS experiments were consistent with chemical probing and X-ray crystallography experiments.
