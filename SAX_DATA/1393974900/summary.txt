#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	ST2 Receptor

BIOISIS_ID	ST2P

EXP_DESCRIPTION	Interleukin (IL)-33 is an important member of the IL-1 family that has pleiotropic activities in innate and adaptive immune responses in host defense and disease. It signals through its ligand-binding primary receptor ST2 and IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), both of which are members of the IL-1 receptor family. To clarify the interaction of IL-33 with its receptors, the crystal structure of IL-33 in complex with the ectodomain of ST2 was determined at a resolution of 3.27 Å. Coupled with structure-based mutagenesis and binding assay, the structural results define the molecular mechanism by which ST2 specifically recognizes IL-33. Structural comparison with other ligand–receptor complexes in the IL-1 family indicates that surface-charge complementarity is critical in determining ligand-binding specificity of IL-1 primary receptors. Combined crystallography and small-angle X-ray–scattering studies reveal that ST2 possesses hinge flexibility between the D3 domain and D1D2 module, whereas IL-1RAcP exhibits a rigid conformation in the unbound state in solution. The molecular flexibility of ST2 provides structural insights into domain-level conformational change of IL-1 primary receptors upon ligand binding, and the rigidity of IL-1RAcP explains its inability to bind ligands directly. The solution architecture of IL-33–ST2–IL-1RAcP complex from smallangle X-ray–scattering analysis resembles IL-1β–IL-1RII–IL-1RAcP and IL-1β–IL-1RI–IL-1RAcP crystal structures. The collective results confer IL-33 structure–function relationships, supporting and extending a general model for ligand–receptor assembly and activation in the IL-1 family.

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	Various concentrations, 0.5-5mg/mL. At the NSRRC 23A beamline, 100 μL of proteins in a sample cell were exposed for 30 and 60 s, and data was collected at wavelength λ = 0.8857 Å (energy, 14.000 KeV) with sample-to-detector distance 2.5 m, resulting in q ranging from 0.0085 to 0.37 Å−1. At the SIBYLS beamline, proteins were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography before data collection; 25 μL of samples was taken from the column fractions and transferred to a 96-well plate, without further concentrating the samples to avoid aggregation. Proteins were loaded into the sample cell by pipetting robot platform and then exposed for 0.5, 1, and 4 s at wavelength λ = 1.0 Å, with sample-to-detector distance 1.5 m, corresponding to q ranging from 0.001 to 0.32 Å−1.

DIAGNOSTIC_LEGEND		Grey = input structure, red = output SAXS results, black = experimental SAXS profile. Structural populations of a) ST2 receptor protein. <Qa,b> indicates structural ensemble consistency. <Qa,b> and a well-fit SAXS profile result in recommended output structures and weights, as shown. The average and standard deviation of the weights (σweights) from the 10 best fits are shown next to their corresponding structures. According to our benchmark, σweights below 0.08 implies an error for the weight of less than 0.13 using a two standard deviation confidence limit. Similarly, above 0.8 suggests the structures likely have an error of less than 5 Å RMSD.
