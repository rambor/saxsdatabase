#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Solution scattering of the trypsin-cleaved UVR8 photoreceptor

BIOISIS_ID	TUVR8P
EXP_DESCRIPTION	The recently identified plant photoreceptor UVR8 (UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8) triggers regulatory changes in gene expression in response to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) light through an unknown mechanism. Our analyses establish how UVR8 functions as a photoreceptor without a prosthetic chromophore to promote plant development and survival in sunlight. SAXS data on trypsin-cleaved sample suggest that the biological assembly of the UVR8 homodimer matches the crystal structure.
SOURCE_LOCATION	ALS BL 12.3.1

PUBLICATION	Plant UVR8 photoreceptor senses UV-B by tryptophan-mediated disruption of cross-dimer salt bridges (2012). Science; 335(6075):1492-6. doi: 10.1126/science.1218091.

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	Data were prepared at 5 mg/mL and then diluted by 2/3 dilution series for a total of 3 samples, and profiles superimposed well. X-ray exposure data from 1 to 5 seconds for the ~2.3 mg/mL sample were used for further analyses.

#REMARK NO MODEL
DESCRIPTION	Modeling of UVR8 is complicated due to flexibility/dynamics of the termini (of unknown structure), even though partially removed by proteolysis.
