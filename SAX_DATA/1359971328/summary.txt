#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	FlaI hexamer formation upon ATP binding.

BIOISIS_ID	

EXP_DESCRIPTION	Three different SAXS dataset were collected: the FlaI ATPase without nucleotide, with ADP (as present in our crystal structure) and with ATP. Without nucleotide, FlaI is present as monomer. Addition of either ADP or ATP induces hexamer formation. With ATP the hexamer has a more compact conformation than with ADP. To trap the protein in the nucleotide bound state for the experiment, we used the Walker B mutant E336A.

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	Three different concentrations were measured with the lowest being the peak fraction from a size exclusion chromatography column run directly before performing the SAXS measurement. The higher concentrations were approx. 2mg/ml and 4mg/ml. Good agreement between the three curves could be observed.

#REMARK NO MODEL
DESCRIPTION	For this experiment we only compared P(r) functions of FlaI with ADP or ATP to verify that ATP binding induces a more compact conformation.
