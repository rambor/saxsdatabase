#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	wtTIA-RRM123, residues 1-247 (CHESS)
BIOISIS_ID	2TIAKP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	Pro-Apoptotic, alternative splicing factor TIA-1 RRM1-RRM2-RRM3 domains in the absence of RNA, for comparison with TIA-1/RNA complex. The average solution conformation of three TIA-1 RRMs is an obtuse V shape. Data collected at CHESS were a reasonable match with the wtTIA-RRM123 data collected at ALS.
SOURCE_LOCATION	CHESS BL F2
PUBLICATION	Three RNA Recognition Motifs Participate in RNA Recognition and Structural Organization by the Pro-Apoptotic Factor TIA-1, Journal of Molecular Biology xx (2011) xxxâ€“xxx

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	wtTIA-RRM123 was purified by gel filtration and confirmed to be monodisperse by DLS. SAXS data were collected from 3 different concentrations (8.0, 4.0, 2.0 mg/mL)and exposed for 3 and 9 minutes. The exposures and then concentrations were merged to create
