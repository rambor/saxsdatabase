#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Unmodified Skp1A from Dictyostelium discoideum

BIOISIS_ID	

EXP_DESCRIPTION	SAXS profile of untagged, full-length, Dictyostelium discoideum Skp1A, recombinantly expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity under non-denaturing conditions using DEAE-Sepharose, phenyl Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and gel filtration chromatographies.  Sample purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Guinier analyses concluded that samples were monodisperse and free from aggregation over the concentration series tested. Three independent methods of Mr estimation for unmodified Skp1 were in close agreement and yielded an average value of 39,300, similar to the expected Mr (37,174) of a Skp1 dimer.
SOURCE_LOCATION	SSRL BL 4-2

PUBLICATION	Glycosylation of Skp1 Affects Its Conformation and Promotes Binding to a Model F-Box Protein M. Osman Sheikh, Christopher M. Schafer, John T. Powell, Karla K. Rodgers, Blaine H. M. Mooers, and Christopher M. West Biochemistry, 2014, Volume 53, Issue 10, 1657-1669

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	Frozen unmodified Skp1 samples were thawed and extensively dialyzed against SAXS Buffer: 50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM TCEP, and 3% (v/v) glycerol. Samples were immediately shipped to Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) Beam Line 4-2 on ice packs and, just prior to SAXS data collection, were centrifuged through a Corning® Costar® Spin-X® 0.22 µm cellulose acetate microcentrifuge tube filter. Scattering data were collected with a Rayonix MX255-HE detector and with 30 microliter sample volumes in oscillating quartz cuvettes over a concentration range of 1.2-9.4 mg/mL at 10°C. The sample to detector distance was set to 1700 mm. Twelve 1-sec exposures were recorded for each sample. SAXS data were collected from buffer samples between each protein sample.
