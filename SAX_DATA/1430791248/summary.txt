#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	HU a38 a38

BIOISIS_ID	HUa38P
EXP_DESCRIPTION	Here we determined crystal structures of these chromosome-associated proteins in complex with native duplex DNA. Distinct DNA-binding modes of HUαα- and HUαβ elucidate fundamental features of bacterial chromosome packing regulating gene transcription. By combining crystal structures with solution X-ray scattering results, we determined architectures of HU’s-DNA nucleoproteins in near physiological conditions.

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	SAXS data were collected at the ALS beamline 12.3.1 (SIBYLS) LBNL Berkeley, California  for HU concentrations of 17 to 200 μM spanning the measured intracellular HU concentrations of 25-100 μM. The wavelength λ=1.0 Å and sample-to-detector distances were set to 1.5m, resulting in scattering vectors, q, ranging from 0.01 Å-1 to 0.32 Å-1. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle.
