#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Structural analysis of the  Salmonella Type Three Secretion SopB/SigE  Complex 

BIOISIS_ID	

EXP_DESCRIPTION	In this work we performed the biochemical and structural characterization of Salmonella SopB/SigE chaperone/effector complex by SAXS. Our results showed that the SigD/SigE complex is assembled in dynamic homo-hexameric-ring-shaped structures with an internal tunnel. In this ring, the chaperone maintains disordered the N-terminal end of SopB molecules, in good position to be reached and processed by the T3SS. This ring dimensionally fits the ring organized molecules of the injectisome including ATPase hexameric ring suggesting that this structural feature is important for its recognition by T3SS. Our work constitutes the first evidence in solution of such an oligomerization analogous to the organization of the secretion machinery. As effectors share neither sequence nor structural identity, the quaternary oligomeric structure could constitute a strategy selected to promote the specificity and efficiency of T3SS recognition.
