#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Human DNA Ligase III-beta

BIOISIS_ID	LIIIBP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	Human DNA ligase III has essential functions in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication and repair and contains a PARP-like zinc finger (ZnF) that increases the extent of DNA nick joining and intermolecular DNA ligation, yet the basis for ligase III specificity and structural variation among human ligases is not understood. Here combined crystal structure and small-angle X-ray scattering results reveal dynamic switching between two nick-binding components of ligase III: the ZnF-DNA binding domain (DBD) forms a crescent-shaped surface used for DNA end recognition which switches to a ring formed by the nucleotidyl transferase (NTase) and OB-fold (OBD) domains for catalysis. Structural and mutational analyses indicate that high flexibility and distinct DNA binding domain features in ligase III assist both nick sensing and the transition from nick sensing by the ZnF to nick joining by the catalytic core. The collective results support a "jackknife model" in which the ZnF loads ligase III onto nicked DNA and conformational changes deliver DNA into the active site. This work has implications for the biological specificity of DNA ligases and functions of PARP-like zinc fingers.

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	Single concentration. Incident x-rays were tuned to a wavelength of λ = 1.0–1.5 Å at a sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, resulting in scattering vectors ranging from 0.007 Å−1 to 0.31 Å−1. Briefly, the data were acquired at short and long time exposures (0.5s, 5s) then scaled and merged for calculations using the entire scattering spectrum.

DIAGNOSTIC_LEGEND		Structural populations of a) unbound DNA ligase III. <Qa,b> indicates structural ensemble consistency. <Qa,b> and a well-fit SAXS profile result in recommended output structures and weights, as shown. The average and standard deviation of the weights (σweights) from the 10 best fits are shown next to their corresponding structures. According to our benchmark, σweights below 0.08 implies an error for the weight of less than 0.13 using a two standard deviation confidence limit. Similarly, above 0.7 suggests the structures likely have an error of less than 8 Å RMSD.
