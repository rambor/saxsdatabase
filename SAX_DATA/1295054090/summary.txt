#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Noise assessment at high q-values
BIOISIS_ID	1GINTP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	10 independent, 5 sec exposures of dilute glucose isomerase at 0.8 mg/ml. Two curves were deposited: 1) average I(q) and 2) median I(q). For further information, see Figure 10 in Supporting Information.

#REMARK NO MODEL
DESCRIPTION	No model fit was provided, this dataset was used to demonstrate propagation of experimental uncertainties from 10 independent measures at a fixed glucose isomerase concentration. The average is the average of 10 separate measurements with associated matching buffer and the median is the median for each I(q) measurement.
