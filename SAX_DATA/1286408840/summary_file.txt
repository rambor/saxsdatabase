#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Solution structure of C3b
DESCRIPTION	SAXS combined with sample repurification using size exclusion chromatography (SEC)  been used to revealed the conformational flexibility of   CUB-TED from the MG Core of C3b. Linear Guinier plots  of scattering profiles of collected peak fractions and its dilutions (1.2–0.5 mg∕mL) indicated that the  C3b was free of nonspecific aggregation and revealed radii of gyration (RG) of 46.8+- 0.3 Å.  We further analyzed our SAXS data using a computational approach (BILBOMD), in which rigid body modeling is combined with simplified molecular dynamics to arrive at minimal ensemble of plausible conformers that best describe experimental data. As the large size of C3b restricts computational simulation of the entire protein, we used a facilitated model wherein the MG core, CUB, and TED were treated as separate rigid bodies connected by flexible linkers. From 10,000 distinct conformations that were generated by constrained molecular dynamics modeling, subsets of two conformations were selected using a minimal ensemble search.  In the case of free C3b, a set of two distinct conformers with a volume ratio of 45% and 55% accurately described the experimental scattering curve (χ2 of 1.1). Although both conformers generally resembled the orientation of the CUB-TED region observed in the crystal structure of C3b, with TED in contact to the MG core, the analysis indicated significant rotations and translation of the TED domain in between the selected conformers.
