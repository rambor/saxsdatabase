#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Characterization of Cu,Zn Superoxide Dismutase from the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis  
BIOISIS_ID	NMSODP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	Mortality rates from N. meningitidis infections remain high despite availability of potent antibiotic treatments. The pathogen contains periplasmic Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (NmSOD). NmSOD is responsible for detoxifying superoxide radicals generated by the host immune response, and thereby contributes to its virulence. SAXS data obtained for the enzyme confirm the dimeric structure obtained by X-ray crystallography.
SOURCE_LOCATION	ALS BL12.3.1
PUBLICATION	To be published

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	Data were collected at 1.18, 1.3 and 2.35 mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline, and profiles superimposed well. Gel filtration matched buffer was used for buffer subtraction. X-ray exposure data from 0.5 to 5 seconds for the 1.3 mg/mL sample were used for m
