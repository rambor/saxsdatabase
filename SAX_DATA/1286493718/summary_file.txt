#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Solution structure of C3b/Efb-C complex
DESCRIPTION	 To generate a conformational model of the complex, we analyzed the solution structures of C3b both free and bound to Efb-C by SAXS combined with sample re-purification using size exclusion chromatography (SEC).  Linear Guinier plots  of scattering profiles of collected peak fractions and its dilutions (1.2 -0.5 mg/ml) indicated that the protein samples were free of non-specific aggregation and revealed radii of gyration (RG) of 46.8±0.3 Å for C3b and 47.6±0.3 Å for C3b/Efb-C (Fig. 2A and S5A). Separately, the derived pair-distribution functions, P(r), and the corresponding Kratky plots for interference-free SAXS profiles also indicated significant conformational changes between free C3b and the Efb-C bound state. We further analyzed our SAXS data using a computational approach (BILBOMD).  As the large size of C3b restricts computational simulation of the entire protein, we used a facilitated model wherein the MG core, CUB and TED were treated as separate rigid bodies connected by flexible linkers. From 10,000 distinct conformations that were generated by constrained molecular dynamics modeling, subsets of two conformations were selected using a minimal ensemble search (31) for each sample. These subsets were analyzed for their ability to describe the experimental scattering curves by calculation of a discrepancy parameter (χ2). In the case of free C3b, a set of two distinct conformers with a volume ratio of 45% and 55% accurately described the experimental scattering curve (χ2 of 1.1). Although both conformers generally resembled the orientation of the CUB-TED region observed in the crystal structure of C3b, with TED in contact to the MG core, the analysis indicated significant rotations and translation of the TED domain in-between the selected conformers. In the case of C3b/Efb-C, however, the ensemble was dominated by a single conformer with a volume ratio of 87%, and a two-conformation model led to minor improvements (χ2 of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively).
