#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Characterization of enzymes from Legionella pneumophila involved in reversible adenylylation of Rab1
BIOISIS_ID	1DRRAP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	After the pathogenic bacterium Legionella pneumophila is phagocytosed, it injects more than 250 different proteins into the cytoplasm of host cells to evade lysosomal digestion and to replicate inside the host cell. Among these secreted proteins is the protein DrrA/SidM, which has been shown to modify Rab1, a main regulator of vesicular trafficking in eukaryotic cells, by transfer of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to Tyr77. In addition, Legionella provides the protein SidD that hydrolytically reverses the covalent modification, suggesting a tight spatial and temporal control of Rab1 function by Legionella during infection. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments of DrrA allowed us to validate a tentative complex model built by combining available crystallographic data. We have established the effects of adenylylation on Rab1 interactions and properties in a quantitative way. In addition, we have characterized the kinetics of DrrA catalyzed adenylylation as well as SidD catalyzed deadenylylation towards Rab1 and have determined the nucleotide specificities of both enzymes. This study enhances our knowledge of proteins subverting Rab1 function at the LCV.
