#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Characterization of Cu,Zn Superoxide Dismutase from the pathogen Brucella abortus
BIOISIS_ID	BASODP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	Brucella abortus is a pathogen that causes brucellosis, presenting severe health and alimentary consequences  impacting humans and animals worldwide. The pathogen contains periplasmic Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, which  detoxifies superoxide radicals generated by the host immune response. Here we describe the monomeric SAXS structure of B. abortus SOD (BaSOD). Structural characterization of the enzyme may enable development of more potent vaccines to globally combat the pathogenic organism.
