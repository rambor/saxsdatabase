#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	IL-33-Bound ST2 Receptor

BIOISIS_ID	

EXP_DESCRIPTION	Interleukin (IL)-33 is an important member of the IL-1 family that has pleiotropic activities in innate and adaptive immune responses in host defense and disease. It signals through its ligand-binding primary receptor ST2 and IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), both of which are members of the IL-1 receptor family. To clarify the interaction of IL-33 with its receptors, the crystal structure of IL-33 in complex with the ectodomain of ST2 was determined at a resolution of 3.27 Å. Coupled with structure-based mutagenesis and binding assay, the structural results define the molecular mechanism by which ST2 specifically recognizes IL-33. Structural comparison with other ligand–receptor complexes in the IL-1 family indicates that surface-charge complementarity is critical in determining ligand-binding specificity of IL-1 primary receptors. Combined crystallography and small-angle X-ray–scattering studies reveal that ST2 possesses hinge flexibility between the D3 domain and D1D2 module, whereas IL-1RAcP exhibits a rigid conformation in the unbound state in solution. The molecular flexibility of ST2 provides structural insights into domain-level conformational change of IL-1 primary receptors upon ligand binding, and the rigidity of IL-1RAcP explains its inability to bind ligands directly. The solution architecture of IL-33–ST2–IL-1RAcP complex from smallangle X-ray–scattering analysis resembles IL-1β–IL-1RII–IL-1RAcP and IL-1β–IL-1RI–IL-1RAcP crystal structures. The collective results confer IL-33 structure–function relationships, supporting and extending a general model for ligand–receptor assembly and activation in the IL-1 family.

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	Various concentrations, 0.5-5mg/mL. At the NSRRC 23A beamline, 100 μL of proteins in a sample cell were exposed for 30 and 60 s, and data was collected at wavelength λ = 0.8857 Å (energy, 14.000 KeV) with sample-to-detector distance 2.5 m, resulting in q ranging from 0.0085 to 0.37 Å−1. At the SIBYLS beamline, proteins were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography before data collection; 25 μL of samples was taken from the column fractions and transferred to a 96-well plate, without further concentrating the samples to avoid aggregation. Proteins were loaded into the sample cell by pipetting robot platform and then exposed for 0.5, 1, and 4 s at wavelength λ = 1.0 Å, with sample-to-detector distance 1.5 m, corresponding to q ranging from 0.001 to 0.32 Å−1.
