#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Lysozyme under varying NaCl concentrations varying between 0 and 1M
BIOISIS_ID	LNaClP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	SAXS profiles for glucose isomerase and lysozyme at the concentration of ~2.5 mg/ml were collected under different ionic strengths using NaCl or KCl concentrations varying between 0 and 1000mM. The SAXS data for contrast variation experiments have been collected using two standard protein glucose isomerase (174 kDa). Protein at the concentration 5mg/ml were first dialyzed in buffer containing 50mM Tris pH 7.6.  Dialyzed proteins were aliquot into the 50uL fractions that were diluted with 50uL of different NaCl salt solutions giving final salt concentration varying between 25mM and 1000mM. The corresponding buffer blanks for SAXS experiments were prepared identically by diluting 50uL aliquots of the dialyzing buffer with salt solutions. SAXS data was collected and analyzed as described previously (Hura, 2009 Nature Method).
