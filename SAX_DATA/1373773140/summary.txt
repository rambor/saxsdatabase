#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Median and Mean Xylanase Data
BIOISIS_ID	1XYNTP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	High noise dataset used to demonstrate propagation of error and influence of noise on Chi-square. 10 independent, 5 sec exposures of size-exclusion chromatography purified xylanase collected to qmax = 0.31 (Ã…-1) at ~1.4 mg/ml. Median SAS curve is the median intensity for each I(q). Intensities and associated uncertainties that are taken as the median best approximate the average I(q) without signal enhancement from averaging. Model fits with CRYSOL to PDB: 1REF produced a chi2 of 0.995 and chi2free of 1.66.  Average SAS curve  is the average intensity for each I(q). Model fits with CRYSOL produced a conventional chi2 of 1.00 and chi2free of 1.56.
