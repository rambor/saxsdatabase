#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs induces a conformational change that enlarges the cleft between the head and palm regionsPhosphorylated (P-DNA-PKcs) and unphosphorylated DNA-PKcs revealed different scattering profiles over the entire scattering range. Broadening in the P(r) maxima, an increase in particle dimension (from 155Å to 180Å) and increased RG values (from 55 to 57Å). Both averaged and individual SAXS models reveal the presence of the palm and head regions and the cavity in the head region. Comprison with crystal structure suggests that autophosphorylation leads to enlargement of the cleft between the head and palm regions.
