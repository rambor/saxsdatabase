#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	MnmE bound to GppNHp
BIOISIS_ID	MNME3P
EXP_DESCRIPTION	SAXS data of E. coli MnmE bound to GppNHp. MnmE was expressed in E. coli and purified via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by the removal of bound nucleotides using alkaline phosphatase. Subsequently MnmE was purified via a second Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and gel filtration. MnmE was measured in the presence of 1 mM GppNHp. Sample homogeneity was assessed using SEC-MALS.
