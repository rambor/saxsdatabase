#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	P4-P6 RNA domain at 7.6 mM MgCl2
DESCRIPTION	SAXS profile of the P4-P6 RNA domain using gel-filtration purified samples.  Refolding of the RNA produces folding artifacts which must be removed from the sample prior to SAXS.
SOURCE_LOCATION	ALS BL12.3.1
PUBLICATION	Improving Small-Angle X-ray Scattering Data for Structural Analyses of the RNA World (2010), RNA, Vol. 16(3):638-646

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
WAVELENGTH	1.03328
EXP_DETAILS	RNA was snap re-folded and concentrated to 10 mg/mL before loading onto a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column.  The peak fraction was taken (60uL) for SAXS data collection.  A 2/3rds dilution series was performed and data was collected at 4 different concentrations starting at approximately 2mg/mL.
