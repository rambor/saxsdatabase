#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	P4-P6 domain at 7.6 mM MgCl2
BIOISIS_ID	1P4P6R
EXP_DESCRIPTION	SAXS profile of the P4-P6 domain.  Refolding of the RNA produces folding artifacts that must be removed from the sample prior to SAXS data collection.  In this case, the samples were thermally refolded and purified by size-exclusion chromatography immediately prior to SAXS analysis.  Sample homogeneity was assessed using multi-angle light scattering methods during chromatographic separation
