#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Divalent Free Yeast tRNA-Phe
DESCRIPTION	Yeast tRNA-Phe annealed in EDTA buffer and purified through a size-exclusion column prior to SAXS analysis.  The chromatography buffer contained 2 mM EDTA and 50 mM KCl.  The KCl or monovalent was necessary to prevent concentration dependent scattering effects at high concentrations of RNA.

#REMARK NO MODEL
DESCRIPTION	The tRNA in Mg-free buffer was significantly unfolded as judged by the Kratky plot.  The plot suggests that the RNA resembles a random coil in the absence of Mg2+.  Therefore, the data was not suitable for any ab initio shape reconstructions.
