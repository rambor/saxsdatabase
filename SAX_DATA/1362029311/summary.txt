#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	SAXS analysis of native and oxidised low density lipoprotein (LDL)

BIOISIS_ID	

EXP_DESCRIPTION	Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering analysis in line with size exclusion chromatography (SEC-SAXS) was performed on native human LDL and Cu2+ oxidised human LDL (oxLDL). This technique allowed the global paramters of LDL and oxLDL to be compared in isolation, free of contamination by aggregates. While the maximum dimension of the LDL particle did not change dramatically upon oxidation, the Rg decreased and there were diagnostic changes in the P(r) function, consistent with a loss of ordered cholesterol ester and triacyglycerol structure.
SOURCE_LOCATION	Australian Synchrotron SAXS/WAXS beamline

PUBLICATION	Simultaneous binding of the anti-cancer IgM monoclonal antibody PAT-SM6 to low density lipoproteins and GRP78. PLoS ONE. Under review
