#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	TAPBPR (TAP Binding Protein, Related)
BIOISIS_ID	TAPBPP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	Human TAPASIN and TAPBPR (TAP Binding Protein, Related) are homolog proteins.  TAPASIN is a part of the classical MHC-I peptide-loading complex (PLC), but TAPBPR is not a component of the PLC.  Both interact with MHC-I molecules, but the functionality is different.  Results of site-directed mutagenesis of HLA-A2 and TAPBPR are consistent with a view that TAPASIN and TAPBPR share a similar mode of MHC-I binding.  The coordinates model of TAPASIN is available from the complex structure of TAPASIN with ERp57 (PDB ID: 3F8U), but the crystallization of TAPBPR and its complexes is difficult.  We determined the low resolution structure or “shape” of the TAPASIN and TAPBPR by SAXS studies, and compared the structural similarity and differences.

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	At BioCAT (18ID/APS) beamline, a size-exclusion chromatography method for data collection was used.  The concentration of the loading sample is about 5mg/ml.  Purified TAPASIN protein was run in line on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/30 column at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min directly connected to the sample chamber, and the scattering data were collected with one second exposure per frame during the sample flow through.  In this way, the possible aggregation is removed instantly. Two-dimensional diffraction images were reduced to one dimension scattering data and buffer scattering was subtracted.  Radius of gyration (Rg), Guinier plot fit and pair-wise distance distribution P(r) calculations were performed using PRIMUS.  The dummy residue models were produced using DAMMIN/DAMMIF.  The envelopes were reproduced by pdb2vol of SITUS and rendered by VMD. A comparison of Rg and fitness between pdb structures and derived models and the SAXS experimental data were made with CRYSOL.

DESCRIPTION		homolog pdb file of TAPBPR, based on the template of TAPASIN (3F8U_B) by the modeling MMM server (http://manaslu.aecom.yu.edu/MMM/).

#REMARK NO MODEL
DESCRIPTION	The SAXS envelope of TAPBPR was computed by PDB2VOL of SITUS.  The homolog model of TAPBPR was docked to the envelope by COLORES of SITUS.  The figure was rendered by VMD.
