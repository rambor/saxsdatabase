#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	U2AF65 RRM1-RRM2, with N- and C-terminal flanking sequences
BIOISIS_ID	2U2FKP
EXP_DESCRIPTION	SAXS profile of human U2AF65 RRM1-RRM2, residues 136-347, with N-terminal 'GPLGS' sequence from protease site. This residue range includes 12 residues N-terminal to RRM1 and 11 residues C-terminal to RRM2. Sample was purified by gel filtration and homogeneity was verified by dynamic light scattering prior to data collection.
SOURCE_LOCATION	ALS BL 12.3.1
PUBLICATION	Major Contribution of Elongated Conformations to the Solution Ensemble of the Essential Splicing Factor U2AF65, submitted

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	Samples at 5 or 10 mg/mL were used for 6s and 60s exposures, followed by a 6s exposure to check for radiation damage. Appropriate resolution ranges of the exposures and concentrations were merged in the final data file.

DIAGNOSTIC_LEGEND		The radii of gyration (RG) of the structures are plotted on the x-axis, against the frequency with which a structure of a given RG occurs in the selected ensemble on the y-axis. Gray dashed lines represent the randomized starting pool of structures. Solid lines are the selected pool (2 PDB ensemble - best fit when compared with 3,4,5,20-PDB) showing the presence of two major types of conformations
