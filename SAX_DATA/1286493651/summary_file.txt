#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Solution structure of DNA-PKcs 
DESCRIPTION	To define the structure of DNA-PKcs in solution, we generated SAXS profiles over a protein concentration range of 1.5-15 mg/ml.  The SAXS curves displayed a concentration-dependence arising from the tendency of DNA-PKcs to undergo self-association at high protein concentrations. Interference-free SAXS profiles were estimated by extrapolating the measured scattering curves to infinite dilution. Analysis of the interference free SAXS profile, which represents the monomeric state of DNA-PKcs, shows a typical globular particle with a Dmax of ~155Ã…. Although variation exists between the individual SAXS envelopes, the position of the head and palm regions previously described in cryo-EM envelopes and crystal structure  could be visualized. Similar to the 3D-EM reconstructions, the SAXS envelopes show distinct hollow features located inside the head region. Our SAXS envelopes show flattening of the shape in one direction which is consistent with the structure determined crystallography. To test the accuracy of the DNA-PKcs shape, we measured a second independently prepared sample. The P(r) functions matched well and the reconstructed average shapes show identical structural features in handedness symmetry in both possible hands as expected.
