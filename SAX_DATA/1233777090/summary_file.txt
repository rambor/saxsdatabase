#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Unfolded Lysine Riboswitch in Mg2+ Free Buffer
DESCRIPTION	Part of a larger set of experiments examining the various conformational states of the lysine riboswitch in solution. Though the RNA is considered "unfolded" in the absence of Mg2+, the P(r) distribution shows a major peak at ~50 Angstroms suggesting the RNA still maintains a significant amount of side-by-side helical packing.  The Kratky plot suggests the RNA is behaving more like a random coil, thus the RNA is flexible in the absence of Mg2+ with significant side-by-side helical packing.  Not the shoulder at 23 Angstroms is consistent with the width of an A-form helix.

ANNOTATION	Thermotoga maritima asd lysine riboswitch ligand binding domain (161 nt).  Found in B. subtilis and E. coli and is implicated in conferring S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine (AEC) resistance.

#REMARK NO MODEL
DESCRIPTION	No structural model was attempted with this data set.  Mg2+ appears to be important for folding the Lysine riboswitch into a compact/stable structure.  The Kratky plot suggests the riboswitch is behaving like a random coil in solution with a maximum dimension of 172 Angstroms which is greatly reduced to 108 Angstroms when Mg2+ is present.
