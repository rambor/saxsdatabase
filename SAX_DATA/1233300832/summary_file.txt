#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Purified Yeast tRNA-Phe
DESCRIPTION	Native yeast tRNA-Phe purified through a micro size-exclusion column prior to SAXS data collection.  The commercially obtained tRNA is a mixture, as judged by the chromatogram, however, there was a single major peak which was used for the analysis.
