#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	HU aa

BIOISIS_ID	HUaa1P
EXP_DESCRIPTION	Distinct DNA-binding modes of HUαα- and HUαβ elucidate fundamental features of bacterial chromosome packing regulating gene transcription. By combining crystal structures with solution X-ray scattering results, we determined architectures of HU’s-DNA nucleoproteins in near physiological conditions.
SOURCE_LOCATION	ALS SIBYLS

PUBLICATION	Shift in the HU multimerization controlling DNA architecture, Science (2015)

#REMARK EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
EXPERIMENTAL_DETAILS	SAXS data were collected at the ALS beamline 12.3.1 (SIBYLS) LBNL Berkeley, California for HU concentrations of 17 to 200 μM spanning the measured intracellular HU concentrations of 25-100 μM (12). The wavelength λ=1.0 Å and sample-to-detector distances were set to 1.5m, resulting in scattering vectors, q, ranging from 0.01 Å-1 to 0.32 Å-1. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle. All experiments were performed at 20°C and data was processed as described (11). The buffer for SAXS experiments resembled intracellular ionic strength: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF. To collect SAXS for protein-DNA assemblies, proteins HUαα, HUαβ or HUα38α38, respectively, were mixed with DNA directly prior the data collection (~5min) at the molar protein:DNA ratios as indicated
