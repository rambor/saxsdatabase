#REMARK SUMMARY
TITLE	Replication Protein A DNA-Binding Core (RPA-DBC)

BIOISIS_ID	

EXP_DESCRIPTION	SAXS profile of the DNA-binding core of Replication Protein A (RPA).  The construct used in these experiments contains principal DNA-binding domains 70A and 70B which are flexibly linked in tandem to RPA's trimeric core, which contains the remaining two DNA-binding domains 70C and 32D and the structural domain 14.
SOURCE_LOCATION	ALS BL12.3.1

PUBLICATION	A new structural framework for integrating replication protein A into DNA processing machinery Nucleic Acids Research 2013, doi: 10.1093/nar/gks1332
